# Python - Recognition and Customisation of Electricity Consumption Patterns 

Using genuine anonymous household electricity usage logs, this app detects, clustering and visualise 
consumption patterns. It applies these patterns to diverse electricity plans, predicting yearly bills 
and associated carbon emissions. Adjusting the pattern reveals potential cost savings under new usage 
patterns.

This app is coded to run on AWS Lambda serverless
